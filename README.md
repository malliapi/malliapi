# Profile

### I am a full-stack developer and even though my focus has been on the front-end, I also possess strong leadership skills, back-end, architecture, DevOps as well as hardware skills. I am proactive about learning and regularly attend community conferences. I have a particular appreciation for visuals and usability and thus my career direction is focused on enhancing these with the help of creative, UX, and optimization (A/B testing) teams.

### I am currently freelancing for a short contract during COVID-19 as a Senior ReactJS/NextJS developer for an open banking web application where I am building a NextJS Web App with an Apollo Federation Gateway server to demo the product’s API to their perspective clients.

### Previously, I was the Technical Lead for search, bookings, and checkout at Eurostar for close to 3 years where my team had delivered features that were worth circa £15 million in incremental revenue over my leadership period.

### I have also previously led and managed technical teams at Deloitte Digital in London. My responsibilities have included team management, leadership, client negotiation, hiring, requirements analysis, component design and implementation using TDD and BDD, code refactoring, and delivering application training to oshore locations.

### I possess close to 11 years of professional and freelance work experience, including experience working in e-commerce, corporate financial institutions, and technology consultancies.

### I have graduated from University College London in 2008 with a 2:1 BSc(Hons) in Computer Science.
