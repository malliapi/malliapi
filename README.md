# Profile

### I am a full-stack developer and even though my focus has been on the front-end, I also possess strong leadership skills, back-end, architecture, devops as well as hard-ware hacking skills. I am proactive about learning and regularly attend community conferences. **I have a particular appreciation for visuals and usability and thus my career direction is focused towards enhancing these with the help of creative, UX and optimisation (A/B testing) teams.**

### My responsibilities have included team management, leadership, client negotiation, hiring, requirements analysis, component design and implementation using TDD and BDD, code refactoring, and delivering application training to offshore locations.

### I possess close to 10 years of professional and freelance work experience, including experience working in E-commerce, corporate financial institutions and technology consultancies.

### I have graduated from University College London in 2008 with a 2:1 BSc(Hons) in Computer Science.
